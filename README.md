# Adventures in Python

This repo is meant to be the foundation for the CSD class offered by **Falk Kühnel** and **Björn Jensen** of **Jensen und Komplizen**. 

## Preparation
In order to be able to follow this tutorial you need to have to install the following things:

- Python 3.x 
- PIP

## Step 01 - Create and set up the working environment
Create the directory you are going to use to create your webapplication. In order to keep your system clean it is a good idea to create a virtual environment in this directory: 

`$ python3 -m venv venv`

In order to be able to work in this virtual environment you have to activate it:

`$ source venv/bin/activate`

Now your terminal should look like this:

`(venv) $ _`
